### ***uni-little-helper***

A repository made of little scripts to help academics or total beginners to find some examples of how to do simple data wrangling/processing.  
Something that I'm always looking for during my coding journey as a PhD student in Political Science.

The aim is to provide better and understandable examples.

Just copy the code!
